			This visualization focuses on the way Facebook manages users' data, specificly regarding default privacy settings. It is an interactive visualization that advances from the current year to the next year each time the chart is clicked. When clicked, the graph animates, showing the expansion of default privacy settings to a wider audience, year after year. The author used a pie chart to represent the data, and deliberately used Facebook's color scheme, with only three colors total in the visualization. The chart's 11 slices represent different areas of personal data, from Birthdays to Wall Posts, while the rings within the chart represent which Facebook connections can access the data.

			In my opinion, the rationale behind the minimal color choices is to force the user to focus on the overall chart and the way it expands, rather than the individual pie chart slices. Since there is only one metric in the visualization, it would be unnecessary and distracting to use more than one color as a fill. The choice to use a pie chart was most likely due to the fact that the author wanted to express 11 different attributes in an easy to digest way, with equal proportions. I think this is a good visualization because it is informative and very easy to digest. Within seconds, a viewer can understand the goal of the visualization, and the legend is so simple it is almost unnecessary.
