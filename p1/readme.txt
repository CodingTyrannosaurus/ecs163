Current Progress:

I have sorted, filtered, and extracted the data I plan to use, which comes from the college scorecard data. I also created a scatterplot comparing colleges acceptance rates with students median earnings after 10 years.

1st Question:

How much do admission rates and class size effect earning potential? Do smaller, more selective colleges churn out higher earning graduates?

1st Visualization:

Scatterplot with points as marks and color, size, and position as channels. I need to add a legend for clarity, but I am still figuring out how to do that using size in D3.
