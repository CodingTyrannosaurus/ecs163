I added interactivity in each of my charts, varying from tooltips to transitions when buttons are clicked. I also animated these transitions by fading out certain points to emphasize important ones, and changing the width of lines in my third chart so the user can observe one school at a time. I also think I performed particularly interesting analysis on the data because I compared a subset of the data to the rest, then performed comparisons within that subset, analyzing specific attributes that differentiate each element in the subset.
